# Devcade Documentation

On this website you can find any documentation you need for working with the Devcade project, whether you want to make a game, leverage the API, or build your own machine.

?> Note: If something doesn't look right, feel free to suggest an addition or change with the "Edit on github" button up in the corner.

## What is Devcade?
Devcade is a fully custom arcade machine made by members at RIT's [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu). Devcade is an arcade built for developers, by developers. The arcade cabinet, software, and games for Devcade were all built by CSHers starting from the 2022 Fall semester.

The arcade cabinet was first shown off at the 2022 Rochester Makerfaire and many more times since. This cabinet is the first of its kind, but hopefully not the last. 

Learn more about Devcade at the [main website](https://devcade.csh.rit.edu).

## Quick start

### Making a game
We officially support and have resources for Monogame games written in C# and have community support for Bevy games written in Rust. Some other engines and frameworks have been explored but don't yet have full support. 

- [Getting Started](/Getting-started/)
- [Monogame Template](/template-repo)
- [Monogame Library](/library-repo)
- [Flatpackify](/flatpackify-repo)

- [Rust Library](https://docs.rs/devcaders/latest/devcaders/)(Community supported)

?> Devcade can theoretically run any executable as long as the game is formatted properly, runs on linux, and works with a few other restrictions but you will have to figure some stuff out yourself that would be done for you in one of our libraries and we make no guarantees on getting it to work.

### Working on the project
For information on how the project works and implementation details, check out the sections on each part of the project:

- [Onboard Software](/onboard-repo)
- [Website](/website-repo)
- [API](/api-repo) 

### Building your own
Ideally, anyone should be able to take this information and set up their own Devcade! Unfortunately, thats not a quick and easy process yet but keep an eye out, we're working on it!
